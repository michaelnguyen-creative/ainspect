why didn't download from Inspections sharepoint list (which include attachments) & save to local collection work on ios? it works well on browser...

✅ Great question, Michael — this is a **well-known limitation** that trips up many PowerApps engineers building for mobile (especially iOS). Let’s break it down carefully.

---

## 🔍 **Why downloading attachments from SharePoint works in browser but fails on iOS**

### 1️⃣ **Browser (desktop / web player)**

* PowerApps web player inherits your browser’s SharePoint authentication cookie/session.
* When you bind directly to `.Attachments` or use `ThisItem.AbsoluteUri`, the browser transparently fetches the attachment behind the scenes using your existing auth session.

✅ Result: Works fine in browser.

---

### 2️⃣ **iOS PowerApps player**

* The PowerApps mobile player **does not have the same seamless auth path** to SharePoint attachments.
* Even though PowerApps is signed in, the attachment URLs (e.g. `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/...`) require:

  * A valid SharePoint cookie/session, or
  * A pre-authorized access token, or
  * The attachment to be served via a PowerApps-friendly API or via Flow that fetches + passes content.

❌ Result: When you use `ThisItem.AbsoluteUri`, PowerApps player tries to download the file but has **no SharePoint auth context** → **fail / blank image**.

---

## ⚠ **iOS-specific security restrictions**

* iOS PowerApps player is sandboxed; it doesn’t pass cookies or tokens to third-party URLs (like SharePoint attachments).
* Even if the URL works in Safari or Edge on iOS → PowerApps can’t leverage that auth context.

---

## 🛠 **What works reliably across platforms**

👉 Instead of trying to display attachment URLs directly:

* Use **Power Automate** to **fetch attachment binary content at sync time** (or on-demand)
* Return Base64 image content to PowerApps
* Bind gallery image to:

```powerapps
Image: "data:" & ThisItem.FileType & ";base64," & ThisItem.FileContent
```

* Store `DownloadedMedia` locally (e.g., `SaveData(DownloadedMedia, "DownloadedMedia")`) for offline access.

---

## 💡 **Summary**

✅ Works in browser: because the browser has SharePoint auth context
❌ Fails on iOS: PowerApps player lacks SharePoint cookie/session for direct file download
✔ Best solution: Download the file content into PowerApps at sync time (via Power Automate)

gallery items = ...attachments, item Image = thisitem.absoluteuri works on browser (desktop) not on mobile (ios)

✅ **You’ve spotted a common PowerApps + SharePoint + iOS pitfall, Michael.** Let’s break it down carefully so you understand *why* it happens and *how* to address it.

---

## ⚡ **Why it works on browser but not iOS**

👉 `ThisItem.AbsoluteUri` points to the SharePoint-hosted URL of the attachment file.
👉 On desktop/browser:
Your browser session (same domain / login context) automatically handles the authentication and serves the image.

👉 On **iOS PowerApps app**:

* The PowerApps mobile player doesn’t automatically pass your SharePoint authentication cookie when accessing file URLs directly.
* So SharePoint **blocks or doesn’t serve the image** — no auth, no file.

---

## 🛠 **How to handle this**

You have two main options:

---

### 🔹 **Option 1: Display attachments using PowerApps’ built-in SharePoint attachment control**

✅ Use the **attachments control** (the one you’d use on a form bound to SharePoint) — it handles attachment URLs + authentication natively.

➡ Even though you don’t need full edit/upload, you can:

* Add a display form (hidden or visible)
* Bind it to `Gallery_Inspections.Selected`
* Add the **Attachments control**
* It will display thumbnails and handle auth

---

### 🔹 **Option 2: Download/copy attachments at data sync time**

✅ During your sync process:

* Fetch attachments’ file content (via Power Automate)
* Store them in a **local PowerApps collection** (with blobs or Base64 if feasible)
* Bind the gallery to that collection

➡ Then use:

```powerapps
Image: ThisItem.FileContent
```

or:

```powerapps
Image: ThisItem.ImageBlob
```

where you stored the image content.

⚠ *Note*: This approach requires changes in your Power Automate sync flow to return image content as part of sync (can increase payload size).

---

### 🔹 **Option 3: Build a custom image service**

✅ If you want full control:

* Power Automate exposes attachments as Base64 image content
* PowerApps gets that, stores in collection
* Use those in gallery without hitting SharePoint URLs directly

⚠ More complex to maintain but works well offline + cross-platform.

---

## 💡 **Recommended for your case**

👉 Given your app is **offline-first + sync-later**:
➡ Enhance your sync flow to **download & store attachment images locally** (Base64 or blob reference in a collection).

## 🚀 **If you want**

I can help:
✅ Draft the Power Automate flow changes to pull attachment file content
✅ Sketch the PowerApps code to load + display it in a gallery
✅ Optimize to minimize payload + memory impact
