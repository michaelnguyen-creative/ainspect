a work around is to use add picture control in the inspectionform, onselect captures the addpicturecontrol.media or controluploaded.image as fileref in the capturedmedia record, then use a gallery (Gallery1) to display items in capturedmedia that matches this current inspection id (varNewinspectionid). On form submission, collect all images in gallery1 (as Image3.Photo) to their corresponding items in capturedmedia as filecontent
---
✅ **Michael — your workaround idea is actually quite clever, and I’ll help you tighten it into a workable flow. Let’s break it down properly so you can implement it cleanly in PowerApps.**

---

### ⚡ Your idea summarized:

1️⃣ **User adds pictures via `AddPictureControl` on the form (no immediate upload).**
2️⃣ **Each add triggers storing metadata + reference (e.g. `Media` or `Image`) in `CapturedMedia`.**
3️⃣ **Gallery (e.g. `Gallery1`) shows the pictures linked to `varNewInspectionId`.**
4️⃣ **On form submit → collect gallery items’ actual image objects (e.g. `.Photo`) into `CapturedMedia.FileContent`.**

---

### 💡 How to make this work

#### 📌 **1️⃣ When adding picture**

On `AddPictureControl.OnAddFile`:

```powerapps
Collect(
    CapturedMedia,
    {
        Id: GUID(),
        InspectionId: varNewInspectionId,
        FileName: <generate your file name logic>,
        FileContent: Blank(),  // We'll fill this on form submission
        FileRef: ThisItem.Media,  // OR ThisItem.Image if you bind it differently
        Captured: Now(),
        CapturedBy: LoggedInUser.Email,
        SyncStatus: "Pending"
    }
)
```

👉 The idea is that `FileRef` keeps the image object.

---

#### 📌 **2️⃣ Gallery displays by inspection**

`Gallery1.Items`

```powerapps
Filter(CapturedMedia, InspectionId = varNewInspectionId)
```

(You can bind the `Image` property of your image control inside gallery to `ThisItem.FileRef`)

---

#### 📌 **3️⃣ On form submit — populate FileContent**

```powerapps
ForAll(
    Filter(CapturedMedia, InspectionId = varNewInspectionId),
    Patch(
        CapturedMedia,
        ThisRecord,
        {
            FileContent: ThisRecord.FileRef
        }
    )
);
```

✅ Now, `CapturedMedia.FileContent` contains the image blob that can be passed to Power Automate!

👉 Optionally:

```powerapps
SaveData(CapturedMedia, "CapturedMedia")
```

to persist locally.

---

### 🚀 **Advantages**

✅ You’re not storing the blob twice unnecessarily
✅ Images display right in the app (via gallery)
✅ FileContent is populated at the moment of submission, reducing the chance of orphaned refs
✅ Compatible with your Power Automate sync trigger

---

### ⚠ **Caveats**

* `FileContent` will still be a PowerApps blob — Power Automate needs to handle it as binary (pass using `JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData`)
* File size can grow large in local collections if many pictures are added before sync
* This pattern assumes users don’t close the app / lose state before submission

---

### 🌟 **Expert tip**

💡 Consider filling `FileContent` at the moment of adding the picture rather than waiting for submit. That way, your `CapturedMedia` is always sync-ready.

Example:

```powerapps
Collect(
    CapturedMedia,
    {
        Id: GUID(),
        InspectionId: varNewInspectionId,
        FileName: <your logic>,
        FileContent: ThisItem.Media,
        Captured: Now(),
        CapturedBy: LoggedInUser.Email,
        SyncStatus: "Pending"
    }
)
```

(Then you skip the `Patch` at submit.)

I can still access the image by opening ios Files/Powerappps/userdata/localmedia but when I try to save the addpicture.Media => it just saves the ref "appres://blobmanager/..." for the record in the collcation... how to get around this?
---
✅ **Michael, you’ve pinpointed the heart of the issue — let’s break it down precisely and explore workarounds.**

---

### 🚩 **What’s happening**

👉 When you use `AddPicture.Media`:

* It returns a *blob reference* (e.g. `appres://blobmanager/...`)
* The actual image is saved into PowerApps’ isolated sandbox (which iOS stores under `Files > PowerApps > userData > LocalMedia`)

👉 When you store `.Media` into a collection:

* You’re storing that reference (not the raw binary / base64 / file path)
* PowerApps collections don’t give you a way to later access the underlying file content from that blob ref

👉 Later, at sync time:

* Power Automate can’t pull that binary out of `appres://...` — it can only get it if you uploaded it at the moment you captured it.

---

### 🛑 **Why you’re stuck**

PowerApps intentionally *sandboxes* that blob store:
✅ You can display the image in PowerApps
❌ But you can’t access its actual binary data after the fact

This is a security / app model limitation → PowerApps doesn’t give you APIs to expose that blob’s binary content to Power Automate or external systems **after capture + local save**.

---

### 🔑 **What CAN be done**

Here’s the truth:
👉 There is no supported way *inside PowerApps alone* to:

* Capture media with `AddPicture`
* Store it offline for later upload (without immediate upload)
* Later extract the binary from the blob at sync time

👉 What can work:

#### 💡 **Option 1: Upload on capture**

* When user adds a picture → upload immediately to SharePoint / Blob Storage
* Store the uploaded file’s URL / ID in your local form data
* Your inspection form remains offline-first, but media is safely uploaded at capture time
  ➡ **Most practical + supported**

---

#### 💡 **Option 2: Native app + custom sync**

* Have users take photos using native camera app → saved to Photos / Files
* In PowerApps: let users select the file using a file picker (or reference the file name)
* Build a companion app / custom sync agent to upload those files (this is outside of PowerApps, using native code / mobile device management / custom connector)
  ➡ **Much more complex; requires dev resources beyond PowerApps**

---

#### 💡 **Option 3: Switch to `Camera` + base64**

* If image quality can be tuned (e.g. better lighting, closer shots)
* Camera control lets you immediately get base64 image content → can store + sync later
  ➡ But you compromise image quality

---

### 🚀 **Lean implementation advice**

If offline-first is non-negotiable + media quality must be good:
👉 **Upload media at capture time.**
👉 Offline-first the rest of your form data + sync it later.

➡ This pattern is used in almost all successful PowerApps offline-first apps dealing with media:

```plaintext
✅ Media uploaded on capture → no more blob refs to manage
✅ Form data syncs later
✅ Minimal conflict risk
✅ No custom sync agent required
```

---

### 💡 **Why teams accept this pattern**

👉 Trying to defer upload of media in PowerApps leads to:

* Fragile blob refs
* No supported API to rehydrate / extract blobs at sync time
* Complex logic to track file paths or build custom sync outside of PowerApps

👉 Upload at capture → lets PowerApps handle the media as intended.

the idea is ok, but actually mediarecord being passed to automate has filecontent as FileContent":"appres://blobmanager/64e67a11a1be43edb4e000f9f4d59196/1

even when the item sync logic implemented this includebinarydata
```
If(
    Connection.Connected,
    UploadInspectionWithMedia.Run(
        JSON(ThisItem, JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData),
        JSON(
            Filter(CapturedMedia, InspectionId = ThisItem.InspectionId),
            JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData
        )
    ),
    Notify(
        "No internet connection. Please connect to sync.",
        NotificationType.Error
    )
)
```
---
💡 **You're thinking critically — you're exactly right to notice this! Let me break it down clearly, and give you a path forward.**

---

### 🚩 **The root issue**

➡ Even though you're using `JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData`, **the `AddPicture` control stores `.Media` as a reference to a blob URI (e.g., `appres://blobmanager/...`)** — not actual base64 binary data — *unless you handle it explicitly*.

➡ So when you pass `CapturedMedia` to Power Automate:

```json
"FileContent": "appres://blobmanager/64e67a11a1be43edb4e000f9f4d59196/1"
```

⚠ Power Automate can’t access that — it’s an internal Power Apps pointer, not usable in Flow or external APIs.

---

### ✅ **Solution**

👉 **You need to capture and store actual binary data at the time of adding the image.**
Here’s how:

---

### 🔑 **Capture base64 image at source**

When user selects/captures the image via `AddPicture`, instead of:

```powerapps
Collect(CapturedMedia,
    {
        FileContent: AddMediaButton1.Media,   // This gives you the appres:// blob ref
        ...
    }
)
```

👉 Use:

```powerapps
Collect(CapturedMedia,
    {
        FileContent: JSON(AddMediaButton1.Media, JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData),
        ...
    }
)
```

💡 **What happens:**

* This immediately serializes the image as a base64 string and stores it in `CapturedMedia.FileContent`.
* Now when you pass that record to Flow, Flow can decode `FileContent`.

---

### 📝 **Power Automate: how to decode**

In your Flow:

```plaintext
base64ToBinary(triggerBody()?['FileContent'])
```

If you’re passing a list:

```plaintext
base64ToBinary(items('Apply_to_each')?['FileContent'])
```

(depending on your Flow structure)

---

### ⚠ Considerations

* Be mindful: storing base64 strings in your collection will **increase memory usage**! If many high-res photos, consider compressing images at capture (PowerApps doesn’t offer native compression, so design guidelines or limit resolution).
* This approach works offline because you store the actual content locally.

---

### 🌟 Final PowerApps capture pattern

```powerapps
Collect(CapturedMedia,
    {
        FileName: AddMediaButton1.Media.Name,
        FileContent: JSON(AddMediaButton1.Media, JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData),
        InspectionId: varNewInspectionId,
        Captured: Now(),
        CapturedBy: LoggedInUser.Email,
        SyncStatus: "Pending",
        Id: GUID()
    }
)
```

---

### 🔑 Summary

✅ The key change: **capture actual base64 data at the time of adding the picture**
✅ Then pass it to Flow, no more `appres://` issues
✅ Flow decodes + uploads
