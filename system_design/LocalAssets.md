ok, let's implement localassets which includes downloadedassets & capturedassets

✅ Smart move, Michael — merging `DownloadedAssets` + `CapturedAssets` into a `LocalAssets` collection will help unify your app logic and simplify offline/online handling!

Let’s design and implement it **cleanly** 👇

---

## 💡 **Proposed `LocalAssets` schema**

Since you want both downloaded and locally captured assets together, let’s align fields:

| Field           | Source   | Notes                     |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| `AssetId`       | both     | GUID or string ID         |
| `AssetName`     | both     | or whatever you display   |
| `OwningUnit`    | both     | optional                  |
| `OperatingUnit` | both     | optional                  |
| `Source`        | computed | `"Remote"` or `"Local"`   |
| `SyncStatus`    | computed | `"Synced"` or `"Pending"` |

---

## ⚡ **PowerApps logic**

👉 You can build `LocalAssets` cleanly like this:

```powerapps
// Clear first
Clear(LocalAssets);

// Add DownloadedAssets
ForAll(
    DownloadedAssets,
    Collect(
        LocalAssets,
        {
            AssetId: AssetId,
            AssetName: AssetName,  // adapt to your field
            OwningUnit: OwningUnit,
            OperatingUnit: OperatingUnit,
            Source: "Remote",
            SyncStatus: "Synced"
        }
    )
);

// Add CapturedAssets
ForAll(
    CapturedAssets,
    Collect(
        LocalAssets,
        {
            AssetId: AssetId,
            AssetName: AssetName,  // adapt to your field
            OwningUnit: OwningUnit,
            OperatingUnit: OperatingUnit,
            Source: "Local",
            SyncStatus: SyncStatus
        }
    )
);
```

✅ **Alternative cleaner pattern** (if schema is guaranteed compatible):

```powerapps
ClearCollect(
    LocalAssets,
    Ungroup(
        Table(
            {
                Group: AddColumns(
                    DownloadedAssets,
                    Source, "Remote",
                    SyncStatus, "Synced"
                )
            },
            {
                Group: AddColumns(
                    CapturedAssets,
                    Source, "Local"
                )
            }
        ),
        Group
    )
);
```

## 📝 **Where to run this logic**

* `OnVisible` of your main screen (e.g. `AssetItemScreen`)
* After sync completes
* After form submission (if adding a new asset)

---

## 🌟 **Save locally**

If you want offline persistence:

```powerapps
SaveData(LocalAssets, "LocalAssets");
```

…and load it on app start:

```powerapps
LoadData(LocalAssets, "LocalAssets", true);
```

If you'd like, I can help you:
✅ Build this with dynamic fields
✅ Handle schema mismatches cleanly
✅ Add logic to refresh without clearing (for performance)
