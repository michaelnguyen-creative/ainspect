ok, so I think it is more robust to bind the form to local collection which should be "CapturedInspections" (save locally to device storage). 
On app start we must load this collection from local device storage, if this local collection is empty (likely the first time we initialize it, populate it with seeding values which will be clear after the first legit submission). 
On subsequent app start, the app should check for which records in CapturedInspections collection that haven't been synced to sharepoint => trigger sync, synced items should remain on the device for a month or until the user decides to manually delete them

✅ **You’ve mapped out an excellent, robust offline-first architecture, Michael! Let’s lock this down into a clear plan and code sketch so you can implement it smoothly.**

---

## 🚀 **Architecture Summary**

👉 **Local collection:** `CapturedInspections`

* Holds all inspection records (whether synced or not).
* Saved using `SaveData()` → persisted across app restarts.

👉 **On app start:**
1️⃣ Try `LoadData()` for `CapturedInspections`.
2️⃣ If empty → seed with placeholder data (so form can render).
3️⃣ Identify records needing sync → auto-trigger sync.

👉 **Sync policy**

* Auto-sync on startup for unsynced records.
* Synced records stay on device for 30 days (or until user deletes).

## ⚡ **Implementation Flow**

### 🔹 **On App Start**

```powerapps
// Try loading from local storage
LoadData(colCapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections", true);

// If collection is empty (first run / cleared storage)
If(
    IsEmpty(colCapturedInspections),
    ClearCollect(
        colCapturedInspections,
        {
            InspectionId: GUID(),
            AssetId: "",
            Inspected: Now(),
            Status: "Seed",
            SyncStatus: "NotSynced"
        }
    );
    SaveData(colCapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections")
);

// Auto-trigger sync for unsynced records if online
If(
    Connection.Connected,
    ForAll(
        Filter(colCapturedInspections, SyncStatus = "NotSynced"),
        Patch(
            YourSharePointList,
            Defaults(YourSharePointList),
            ThisRecord
        )
    );
    // Update local records' sync status
    ForAll(
        Filter(colCapturedInspections, SyncStatus = "NotSynced"),
        Patch(
            colCapturedInspections,
            ThisRecord,
            { SyncStatus: "Synced", SyncedAt: Now() }
        )
    );
    SaveData(colCapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections")
)
```

---

### 🔹 **On Form Submit**

```powerapps
// Instead of SubmitForm, collect to local collection
Collect(
    colCapturedInspections,
    {
        InspectionId: GUID(),
        AssetId: ddAsset.Selected.Value,  // Example: asset selected in form
        Inspected: Now(),
        Status: "Completed",
        SyncStatus: "NotSynced"
    }
);
SaveData(colCapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections")
```

---

### 🔹 **Periodic Cleanup**

On app start or on user action:

```powerapps
// Remove inspections older than 30 days that are synced
ClearCollect(
    colCapturedInspections,
    Filter(
        colCapturedInspections,
        !(SyncStatus = "Synced" && DateDiff(SyncedAt, Now(), Days) > 30)
    )
);
SaveData(colCapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections")
```

---

### 💡 **UI / UX Enhancements**

* Add a **sync button** for manual sync.
* Add a **clear old data** button.
* Show a gallery of `colCapturedInspections` with `SyncStatus` indicator (e.g. 🟢 Synced, 🔴 Not Synced).

---

## 📝 **Summary**

✅ **Your plan is spot on:**

* Form binds to `CapturedInspections` (local)
* SaveData + LoadData → persistent local storage
* Auto-sync unsynced records when online
* Cleanup synced records older than 30 days
