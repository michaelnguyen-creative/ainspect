Great. Here's how we can **redesign the dataflow** for your simplified, *append-only, offline-first* PowerApps inspection app:

---

## üîÅ **Simplified Dataflow Design: ‚ÄúField Capture Tool‚Äù**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **App Startup (App.OnStart)**

**Goal:** Prepare offline cache, no merging needed.

**Steps:**

* Download and cache *read-only master data*:

  * `Assets`
  * `Existing Inspections` (optional, for reference only)
* Initialize empty collections for:

  * `colLocalInspections`
  * `colLocalMedia`
  * `LocalInspectionMetadata`

**Storage:**
Use `SaveData()` / `LoadData()` to persist `Assets` and `LocalInspections`, `LocalMedia`.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **User Captures a New Inspection**

* User selects an asset from `Assets`
* Fills inspection form
* Captures media using `Camera` ‚Üí saved to `colLocalMedia`
* Inspection record created in `colLocalInspections`

üìç**Note:** Every inspection is **new**, with a **GUID as InspectionId**

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Sync Trigger (Manual or Automatic)**

**When online:**

* Iterate through `colLocalInspections`:

  * Submit to SharePoint (`Inspections` list)
* Iterate through `colLocalMedia`:

  * Attach to corresponding SharePoint item by `InspectionId`

**After success:**

* Update local item `SyncStatus = "Synced"`
* `RemoveIf()` records from collections (optional)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Command Center (Separate App or Portal)**

* **Model-driven app or SharePoint List**:

  * View all submitted inspections/media
  * Audit, approve, tag
  * Optional export/report via Power BI

## üß≠ Summary: Key Principles

| Aspect                  | Approach                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Data direction**      | One-way (Local ‚ûú Remote)           |
| **Editing**             | Not allowed on mobile              |
| **Conflict resolution** | Not needed                         |
| **Offline support**     | ‚úÖ Fully supported via `SaveData`   |
| **Media handling**      | Captured locally, attached on sync |
| **Portal oversight**    | Via command center (not mobile)    |

You said:
I think it might even make more sense to split the app data to remote & local & captured versions (local = downloaded remote + captured)

‚úÖ New Conceptual Model: Split Data into 3 Layers
Layer	Description	PowerApps Collection
Remote	Online data pulled from SharePoint (read-only)	RemoteAssets, RemoteInspections
Local	Cached copy of remote data for offline usage	LocalAssets, LocalInspections
Captured	New, user-submitted (but not yet synced) records	colLocalInspections, colLocalMedia

üì¶ App Structure
Remote (SharePoint)
   ‚Üì   (on AppStart if connected)
Local (Read-only, offline cache)
   ‚Üì   (user creates new)
Captured (User submissions ‚Üí queued for sync)

üß† Naming Convention (Recommended)
Collection	Type	Notes
RemoteAssets	SharePoint	Loaded on AppStart if online
LocalAssets	Cached	Copy of RemoteAssets
RemoteInspections	SharePoint	Optional ‚Äî read-only reference
LocalInspections	Cached	For offline read/reference
colLocalInspections	Captured	New inspections only
colLocalMedia	Captured	Media for captured inspections
