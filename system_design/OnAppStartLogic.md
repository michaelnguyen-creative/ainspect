on app start, let's load CapturedInspections from local device storage, DownloadedInspections as local collection of Inspections & prepare LocalInspections as a merge of DownloadedInspections & CapturedInspections

‚úÖ **Great plan, Michael ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clean, robust structure for your app start logic that achieves exactly that. Let‚Äôs write it clearly, explain the reasoning, and ensure it‚Äôs maintainable.**

---

## üí° **What you want**

| Collection              | Purpose                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CapturedInspections`   | Inspections captured locally (offline-first), pending sync                              |
| `DownloadedInspections` | Inspections downloaded from SharePoint (readonly)                                       |
| `LocalInspections`      | Merged list = `DownloadedInspections` + `CapturedInspections`, for display or reporting |

## üöÄ **Recommended OnStart logic**

```powerapps
// --- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set environment ---
Set(varIsDev, false); // Toggle for dev/test

// --- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load CapturedInspections from device storage ---
If(
    !varIsDev,
    LoadData(CapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections", true)
);
If(
    varIsDev || IsEmpty(CapturedInspections),
    ClearCollect(CapturedInspections, /* Empty on first use, or dev dummy data if you want */)
);

// --- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Download Inspections from SharePoint (if online) ---
If(
    Connection.Connected,
    ClearCollect(DownloadedInspections, Inspections);
    If(!varIsDev, SaveData(DownloadedInspections, "DownloadedInspections"))
,
    // Offline: load from device if available
    If(!varIsDev, LoadData(DownloadedInspections, "DownloadedInspections", true))
);

// --- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Merge collections for display ---
ClearCollect(
    LocalInspections,
    DownloadedInspections
);
Collect(
    LocalInspections,
    CapturedInspections
);
```

---

## ‚ö° **Why this works**

‚úÖ `CapturedInspections` = only local records (submitted via form)
‚úÖ `DownloadedInspections` = remote SharePoint data (readonly cache)
‚úÖ `LocalInspections` = clean unified view (for gallery, reports, search etc.)

---

## üåü **Optional refinements**

üëâ You could:

* Tag each record‚Äôs source (e.g. add `Source: "Remote"` or `Source: "Local"`) during the `Collect` so your gallery can display the origin
* For example:

```powerapps
ClearCollect(
    LocalInspections,
    AddColumns(DownloadedInspections, "Source", "Remote")
);
Collect(
    LocalInspections,
    AddColumns(CapturedInspections, "Source", "Local")
);
```

üëâ Or apply sorting:

```powerapps
ClearCollect(
    LocalInspections,
    SortByColumns(
        Union(
            AddColumns(DownloadedInspections, "Source", "Remote"),
            AddColumns(CapturedInspections, "Source", "Local")
        ),
        "InspectionDate",
        Descending
    )
);
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Final result**

Your app start logic is:
‚û° **Offline-ready**
‚û° **Cleanly separates concerns**
‚û° **Easy to maintain and extend (e.g. sync, filters, etc.)**

üí° If you'd like, I can:

* Write your sync trigger logic
* Help with gallery or report binding
* Draft conflict resolution rules for merged data

Let me know! üöÄ
