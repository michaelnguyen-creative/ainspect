inspection form submission logic, let's refine this (many things have changed like datasource now becomes a local collection, no longer the sharepoint list). 
I can embed sharepoint list submission logic here but I think it will be cleaner if I put it elsewhere keeping this logic modular
- only submitting the form to its datasource which is a local collection persisting to local device storage
- only sync on certain triggers (sync logic is separated from form submission logic)

💯 **Michael, you’re thinking in exactly the right direction: clean separation of concerns. Let’s refine this to match your current architecture (local-first, sync as separate concern).**

## 🚀 **Refined Inspection Form Submission Logic**

### 📝 **Key principles**

✅ **Local-first:** Save to local collection + local device storage.
✅ **Modular:** No SharePoint sync logic here. Keep form submission lean.
✅ **Sync handled separately:** On dedicated triggers (e.g. sync button, app start).

---

### ✅ **Suggested code structure**

```powerapps
// --- 1️⃣ Save session metadata locally ---
ClearCollect(
    LocalInspectionMetadata,
    {
        InspectionDate: varInspectionDate,
        Inspector: varInspector,
        Technician: varTechnician,
        InspectedSite: varInspectedSite
    }
);
SaveData(LocalInspectionMetadata, "LocalInspectionMetadata");

// --- 2️⃣ Create new inspection record ---
Set(
    newInspectionRecord,
    {
        Id: GUID(),
        InspectionId: DataCardValue2.Text,
        AssetId: DataCardValue44.Selected,  // Directly store as record if AssetId is a lookup in SP

        Inspector: DataCardValue1.Text,
        Technician: DataCardValue31.Text,
        InspectedSite: DataCardValue37.Selected.Value,
        InspectionDate: DateValue1.SelectedDate,

        IsPresent: Toggle1.Value,
        AbsenceReason: DataCardValue24.Text,
        UsageStatus: DataCardValue5.Selected.Value,
        DeactivationReason: DataCardValue29.Text,
        ConditionRating: DataCardValue3.Selected.Value,
        ConditionDescription: DataCardValue28.Text,
        OperationalFeedback: DataCardValue6.Text,
        AdditionalNotes: DataCardValue26.Text,
        TechnicalCondition: DataCardValue7.Text,

        InspectionType: DataCardValue54.Text,
        InspectionMethod: DataCardValue33.Text,
        LocationOfInpsection: DataCardValue36.Text,
        GeoLocation: DataCardValue30.Text,
        Inspected: DataCardValue32.Text,

        Recorded: Now(),
        RecordedBy: LoggedInUser.Email,
        SyncStatus: "Pending",
        LastModified: Now(),
        LastSynced: "",
        SyncRetryCount: 0,
        SyncErrorMessage: "",
        ConflictDetected: false,
        ConflictNotes: ""
    }
);
Collect(colLocalInspections, newInspectionRecord);

// --- 3️⃣ Save local collections to device storage ---
SaveData(colLocalInspections, "LocalInspections");
SaveData(colLocalMedia, "LocalMedia");

// --- 4️⃣ Notify user ---
Notify(
    "Inspection saved locally. Data will sync when triggered.",
    NotificationType.Success
);

// --- 5️⃣ Reset form + nav ---
ResetForm(Form1);
Set(varNewInspectionId, "");
Navigate(AssetItemScreen);
```

### ❌ **What we removed**

* 🚫 `SubmitForm(Form1)` — not needed; form isn’t bound to SharePoint
* 🚫 `UploadMediaToSharePoint.Run(...)` — sync handled elsewhere
* 🚫 `RemoveIf(colLocalInspections, ...)` — don't auto-remove; let sync logic manage this
* 🚫 `RemoveIf(colLocalMedia, ...)` — same as above

---

## 🌟 **Why this is better**

✅ Single responsibility: **this logic = local save only**
✅ No hidden sync attempts during form submission
✅ Sync handled by separate, reusable logic (can trigger from: app start, button, timer, etc.)

---

## ⚡ **What your sync logic would do (elsewhere)**

➡ Filter `colLocalInspections` where `SyncStatus = "Pending"`
➡ Patch to SharePoint
➡ Update `SyncStatus`, `LastSynced`, `SyncRetryCount`, etc.
➡ Remove or archive local record if desired

---

## 📝 **Final tip**

👉 Consider adding a separate `SyncNow` button or timer-triggered sync that:

```powerapps
ForAll(
    Filter(colLocalInspections, SyncStatus = "Pending"),
    /* sync logic */
)
```
