Design choice
- Once a record is uploaded, you can’t edit it in the inspection app anymore
- (this is to avoid implementing complex sync & conflict resolution logic in powerapps when multiple people holding multiple local copies of the data)

---

✅ **That is a solid and pragmatic design choice, Michael!**
Let’s break down *why* this is a good call and what it means for your app architecture.

---

### 🎯 **Why this is a good idea**

* **Avoids sync hell:** No need to build complex conflict detection/resolution logic (who made the last change? whose data wins?).
* **Keeps PowerApps simple:** PowerApps offline sync features are limited — you’re working with collections + SaveData + manual sync, not a true distributed database.
* **Protects data integrity:** Once data is in SharePoint (or your backend), it becomes the *single source of truth*. No risk of stale local edits overwriting approved/uploaded records.
* **Makes auditing easier:** All changes happen on the server-side once uploaded; you can version control and track changes in SharePoint.

---

### 🛠 **Implementation tips**

Here’s how you can enforce this cleanly:

1️⃣ **When syncing data to SharePoint**

* Update your local `CapturedInspections` / `LocalInspections` records:

```powerapps
Patch(
    CapturedInspections,
    ThisRecord,
    {
        SyncStatus: "Uploaded"
    }
);
SaveData(CapturedInspections, "CapturedInspections");
```

2️⃣ **On forms/screens**

* Disable form controls or hide *Edit* buttons:

```powerapps
DisplayMode = If(ThisItem.SyncStatus = "Uploaded", DisplayMode.View, DisplayMode.Edit)
```

or

```powerapps
Visible = ThisItem.SyncStatus <> "Uploaded"
```

3️⃣ **In galleries**

* Use visual cues (e.g. icons, color tags) to indicate the record is uploaded + locked:

```powerapps
If(ThisItem.SyncStatus = "Uploaded", Color.Gray, Color.Black)
```

---

### 🌟 **Bonus: What about allowing edits?**

If later you need to allow edits *after upload*, do it safely:

* Build a *separate edit flow* → Pull data from SharePoint live → Submit via normal SharePoint form → Avoid local copies entirely for edits.
* Or create a *Change Request* system → New record representing the edit request → Approved centrally.

---

👉 **Conclusion:**
✅ Your plan to make records immutable post-upload is the right fit for PowerApps offline-first architecture. It will make your app cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.

If you want, I can draft:

* An updated data flow diagram.
* Or sample code for form controls & gallery setup following this rule.
